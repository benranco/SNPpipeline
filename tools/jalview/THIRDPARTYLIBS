The Jalview Desktop relies on a number of third-party libraries.
These can be found in the lib directory, with additional compile
time dependencies in the utils directory.

A number of sources have also been adapted for incorporation into Jalview's source tree

ext.edu.ucsf.rbvi.strucviz2 includes sources originally developed by Scooter Morris and Nadezhda Doncheva for the Cytoscape StructureViz2 plugin. It is released under the Berkley license and we hereby acknowledge its original copyright is held by the UCSF Computer Graphics Laboratory
 and the software was developed with support by the NIH National Center for Research Resources, grant P41-RR01081.
